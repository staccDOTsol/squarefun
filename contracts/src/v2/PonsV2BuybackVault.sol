/**
 * @title PonsV2BuybackVault
 * @notice Holds every launch's bought-back memecoin supply and releases it
 * linearly over five years instead of burning it immediately, splitting
 * every release between the creator and the protocol on the launch's
 * recorded fee shares. One shared deployment serves every launch, the same
 * "single deployment for every token" pattern PonsV2FeeEscrow already uses.
 *
 * Note that the split applies to the release, not to the funding. Both the
 * curve and the hook carve the buyback slice out of the creator's share of
 * the fees alone, so the creator funds the entire lock and then receives
 * only their fee share of it back. Enabling a buyback therefore moves value
 * from the creator to the protocol relative to taking the fees directly,
 * by an amount that grows with `buybackBurnBps`.
 *
 * Deposits use a weighted-average vesting clock instead of per-deposit
 * tranches: a launch's fee sweep can add to its lock on every single sweep,
 * and tracking an unbounded array of tranches would make `release()`'s gas
 * cost grow forever. Instead, each new deposit shifts the launch's single
 * `vestingStart` forward by an amount proportional to the deposit's share
 * of the new total, so a large existing lock is barely disturbed by a small
 * top-up, and a small existing lock is pulled close to the new deposit's own
 * clock. `vestedAmount` at any time reflects a fair, size-weighted blend
 * across every deposit made so far.
