 * @title PonsV2LaunchFactory
 * @notice Deploys a bonding curve and its launch token for every pons v2
 * launch, then graduates the curve into a permanently locked, full-range
 * Uniswap V4 position governed by the shared PonsV2MemeHook.
 *
 * Each curve already trades in the quote asset its pool will use, so
 * graduation never converts between assets and therefore needs no router and
 * no price oracle. It stays split into two permissionless phases so a failed
 * pool seed cannot strand a curve's reserves:
 * - `graduate`: drains the curve's own reserves into this factory. Purely
 *   internal bookkeeping, so it is safe to call automatically from within
 *   the crossing buy itself.
 * - `createGraduatedPool`: seeds the new V4 pool with those reserves, and
 *   stays retryable until it succeeds.
