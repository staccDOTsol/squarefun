 * @title PonsV2GraduationGuard

 * the tick and liquidity math outside PonsV2LaunchFactory's runtime bytecode
 * while modelling the rejections of the real mint, so a launch can never
 * drain its curve into a seed the PositionManager or V4 core would reject.
 *
 * The preflight has to mirror the whole downstream call graph rather than the
 * PositionManager's ABI field widths alone. Phase one is irreversible: it
 * marks the curve graduated and moves its reserves to the factory, so a seed
 * that passes here and reverts in V4 leaves the launch permanently unseedable
 * and recoverable only through the owner's delayed rescue path.
