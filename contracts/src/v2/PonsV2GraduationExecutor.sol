 * its own contract purely so PonsV2LaunchFactory's own bytecode stays under
 * EIP-170's 24576-byte deployed-code limit: the swap-router branching,
 * Permit2 approval dance, PositionManager action encoding, and post-mint
 * dust sweep account for a large share of that size on their own. The
 * factory transfers exactly the assets a mint needs here immediately before
 * calling in, so this contract never holds a balance between transactions.
